# Introduction to R for Health Economics using BCEA

The slides for this lecture are available at [https://gianluca.statistica.it/slides/ispor-2022](https://gianluca.statistica.it/slides/ispor-2022). They are in `html` format --- it's just easier to access them (and make them accessible!) and, if you really would like that, you can print to pdf using your browser facilities (best under Google Chrome). But the slides will also remain available after the workshop.
