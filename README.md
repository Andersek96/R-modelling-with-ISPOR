# ISPOR-short-course-2021-An-intro-to-R
 Materials for the 2021 ISPOR short course entitled 'Health Economic Modeling in R: A Hands-on Introduction'


NOTES:
- Can potentially put links to pre-reads here
- Will need to include instructions for how to use GitHub
- Each instructor can have own folder to include code relating to their section
- Will probably be a good idea to include an init.R code for users to run to install required packages
