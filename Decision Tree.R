# We want to look at the costs, QALYS and probabilities for health states.

# First create some blanks to fill in
c.successful<-c.unsuccessful<-rep(NA,n.treatments)
q.successful<-q.unsuccessful<-rep(NA,n.treatments)
p.successful<-p.unsuccessful<-rep(NA,n.treatments)

# Now let's start with adding the cost information 

# Cost of treatment 
c.treat<-c(2000,150)

c.successful[1]<-10000
c.unsuccessful[1]<-20000 
c.successful[2]<-5000
c.unsuccessful[2]<-10000

# Let's add in the QALY information 

# QALY inputs for each treatment over lifetime horizon
q.successful[1]<-30
q.unsuccessful[1]<-15
q.successful[2]<-25
q.unsuccessful[2]<-23

# Check and see how the costs and qalys are looking

p.successful[1]<-0.7
p.unsuccessful[1]<-1-(p.successful[1])

# Probabilities of successful and unsuccessful on old treatment
p.successful[2]<-0.95

# Again let's check
p.successful
p.unsuccessful



# Again create some blank cells to fill in for the calculations of costs and QALYs
